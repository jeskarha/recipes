For the cupcakes:
1 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon cocoa powder
1½ teaspoons baking powder
½ teaspoon kosher salt
½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature
¾ cup granulated sugar
2 eggs
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
¾ cup whole milk
2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon
toasted black sesame seeds, divided

For the avocado–cream cheese frosting:
4 tablespoons (½ stick) unsalted butter, softened
2 ounces cream cheese, softened
1 avocado, roughly mashed
½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 cup confectioners’ sugar

Make the cupcakes: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt. In a separate, larger bowl, use an electric mixer to cream together the butter and sugar, then mix in the eggs, vanilla and milk. Slowly add the dry ingredients to the bowl with the wet ingredients and mix until just combined. Stir in 2 tablespoons of the toasted black sesame seeds. Pour the mixture into the prepared cupcake liners, filling each one to about half an inch from the top. Bake for 25 minutes, until a tester inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean. Remove the pans from the oven and place them on a wire rack or trivet. Let the cupcakes cool completely in the cupcake pans before removing.

Make the frosting: Using an electric mixer, cream the butter and cream cheese together. Add the avocado and vanilla and mix thoroughly. Add the confectioners’ sugar bit by bit, mixing well until completely combined.

Top each cupcake with some frosting and sprinkle with the remaining teaspoon of black sesame seeds. Unfrosted, the cupcakes will keep in an airtight container at room
temperature for up to 1 week, and the frosting can keep in the refrigerator for 3 days, but will discolor more with each successive day due to oxidation.
